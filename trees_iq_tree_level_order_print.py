"""
Tree Level Order Print:
Given a binary tree of integers, print it in level order.
The output will contain space between the numbers in the same level, and new line between different levels.
For example:

root = Node(1)
root.right = Node(3)
root.left = Node(5)
root.left.left = Node(4)
root.right.left = Node(5)
root.right.right = Node(6)

The output should be:

1 
2 3 
4 5 6
