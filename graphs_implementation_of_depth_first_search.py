DFS: https://jeremykun.com/2013/01/22/depth-and-breadth-first-search/

Explores possible vertices (from a supplied root) down each branch before backtracking.
This property allows the algorithm to be implemented succinctly in both iterative and recursive forms.
Upon each visit to a node:
    1.Mark the current vertex as being visited.
    2.Explore each adjacent vertex that is not included in the visited set.
Assume the following simplified version of the graph:
graph = {'A': set(['B', 'C']),
         'B': set(['A', 'D', 'E']),
         'C': set(['A', 'F']),
         'D': set(['B']),
         'E': set(['B', 'F']),
         'F': set(['C', 'E'])}

         'B': set(['A', 'D', 'E']),

            stack.extend(graph[vertex] - visited)  # graph['A'] = set(['B', 'C']) --> set(['B', 'C']) - set ('A'). Using Pythonâ€™s overloading of the subtraction operator.
    return visited
